# Household

Unofficial module for the Household RPG from Two Little Mice. A beautiful game like this deserves a beautiful character sheet.

2. Create a world with the system Custom System Builder ( https://foundryvtt.com/packages/custom-system-builder ). I call mine Household to make things easy.

3. After activating the module in your world created with Custom System Builder go directly to the Configuration Options (gears icon) >> Custom System Builder settings and add the CSS used in the correspondent field. Copy and paste the following:

    modules/household-csb/styles/household.css

That's it. Save it and reload and you are ready to go.

To import everything you need to start go to the Compendiums (1), right-click on each one of the compendiums, and select **Import All Content**, selecting the option to **Keep Documents IDs**. (2), This will populate your game with everything you need to play. Also is important to open the folder on the hotbar, ***give Observer permission to the players for the macros*** (wight click on the macro folder to change permissions), and click and drag each one of the macro rolls to a slot in the macro hotbar, we will be using them to make rolls in Household RPG.
