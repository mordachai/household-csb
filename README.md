# household-csb

Un-official module for the Household RPG from Two Little Mice. A beautiful game like this deserves a beautiful character sheet.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nThis module uses the Custom System Builder and the only thing you need to do to configure it is go to Configure Settings (gear icon)  >>  Custom System Builder settings and add the CSS used in the correspondent field. Copy and paste the following:

module/household-csb/styles/household.css

That's it. Save it and reload and you are ready to go.
