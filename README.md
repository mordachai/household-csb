# Household
*made with Custom System Builder*

Unofficial module for the Household RPG from Two Little Mice. A beautiful game like this deserves a beautiful character sheet.

### IMPORTANT: Install Instructions:

1. Install the module using the manifest link below in your Manifest URL field, in the Install Module section on Foundry VTT:

2. Create a world with the system Custom System Builder ( https://foundryvtt.com/packages/custom-system-builder ). I call mine Household to make things easy.

3. After activating the module in your world created with Custom System Builder go directly to the Configuration Options (gears icon) >> Custom System Builder settings and add the CSS used in the correspondent field. Copy and paste the following:

    modules/household-csb/styles/household.css

That's it. Save it and reload and you are ready to go.

To import everything you need to start go to the Compendiums (1), click on the Adventure compendium (2), click on the Prepare Table adventure (3), and **Import Adventure** (4) it will populate your table with all the assets that you need.
