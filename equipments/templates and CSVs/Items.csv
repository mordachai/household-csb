Commonly used in battle or during military parades. It's impossible to not get noticed when wearing this! A set of heavy armor poses a Hindrance when running, climbing, swimming, sneaking, or trying to go unnoticed. When you fill the Crucial Box during a fight or because of a physical danger, you do not suffer a Condition. When you become Overstressed, your armor breaks and you remove all Stress after the Crucial Box. Repairing a set of heavy armor costs 4 Coins.",6

dueling,Lancetta,/modules/household-csb/equipments/lancetta.webp,"Heavy, Dueling Weapon.","Flat and wide dueling sword suited for both cutting and thrusting. The dueling lancetta was first used as a weapon in the Horde, where the Fencing Academy of the Mirandola Gulf stands to this day. The lancetta (lit.

Littlings who favor this weapon have an explosive and versatile style, suitable both for offense and defense.",5
dueling,Dueling Halfscissor,/modules/household-csb/equipments/dueling-halfscissor.webp,"Sharpened, Dueling Weapon.","Dueling saber best suited for cutting and for mounted combat.

Among the most noteworthy models of this weapon we have the Feuerlang Precision Pistol, designed by Colonel Feuerlang of the Porcelain Army and outfitted with an extremely long and often embellished barrel.

ranged,Musket,/modules/household-csb/equipments/musket.webp,Two Handed Firearm. Gain +1 to shoot.,"A trusty household rifle. Among the many models, I’d like to name the historical Chesterfield musket, developed and produced in the Hearth town with the same name, reliably employed by many armies.",3
ranged,Hunting Rifle,/modules/household-csb/equipments/hunting-rifle.webp,"Two Handed, Accurate Firearm. Gain +1 to shoot.","A high-precision musket. The secret to its long range hides in the rifling inside the barrel, which could be the beginning of a true revolution in firearms.

Gain +1 to shoot.",A Heavy Keysket is best suited for close combat and can deal heavy damage thanks to the heft of the large metal bit. Hunters who favor this type of keysket love to face dangers head-first. They are usually more skilled in combat than they are in the subtle art of stakeout.,6
ranged,Long Keysket,/modules/household-csb/equipments/long-keysket.webp,"Two Handed, Reach Weapon / Two Handed, Accurate Firearm. Gain +1 to shoot.",Best suited for use at a distance.

melee,Double-Bitted Key,/modules/household-csb/equipments/double-bitted-key.webp,"Two Handed, Heavy, Sharp Weapon.","This heavy two handed key has two sharp blades.

melee,Razor,/modules/household-csb/equipments/razor.webp,"Two Handed, Sharp, Wide Weapon.","This cleaver with a wide and flat blade is perfect for littlings who want everyone to know how tough they are. The weapon was first modeled by smiths in Tuberdam to resemble the Master’s Razor and developed to cut down the mounts of opponents during cavalry charges. Fortunately, it has never been used on a wider scale because of its exorbitant production costs and unwieldiness.",3
melee,Halberd Key,/modules/household-csb/equipments/halberd-key.webp,"Two Handed, Heavy, Reach Weapon.","This polearm features a key bit at one of the extremities. Long ago, it was widely used by battalions throughout the House, but nowadays it is mostly wielded by honor guards and by soldiers posted at famous places or events.",3

melee,Bolt,/modules/household-csb/equipments/bolt.webp,"Two Handed, Heavy, Wide Weapon.","A large bolt with a blocky head. Requires two hands to use and is about as wieldy and elegant as a barstool, but hits much harder.",2
melee,Cutlery Piece,/modules/household-csb/equipments/cutlery-piece.webp,Weapon.,"There are three different types of cutlery pieces: knives, forks, and spoons.
