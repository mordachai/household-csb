Barrage,"<strong>Barrage: </strong>The Opponent has two alternating lines of shooters: as the first line shoots, the other reloads. Characters always suffer 1 Stress when attacking with melee weapons. Characters who can rely on a shield or wide weapon may ignore this Trait."
Beast,"<strong>Beast: </strong>The Opponent is a beast or group of beasts."
Cobweb,"<strong>Cobweb: </strong>The Opponent shoots cobwebs at great speed. During their Reaction Turn, Characters outside of combat must make Reaction Rolls with Elusion + War. If they fail, they get trapped in sticky cobwebs that impede their every move. During their turn, Characters may get free from cobwebs with a Critical Action Roll in Strength + War. So long as they are trapped, Characters fail all Reaction Rolls without rolling the dice. Characters who can rely on a sharpened weapon may use their action to free a friend without rolling the dice. Boggart Characters who go juggernaut immediately break free from cobwebs without needing to use an action."

Giant,"<strong>Giant: </strong>The Opponent is a gigantic beast, as tall as ten littlings. Giant Opponents gain all benefits of both the Huge and Heavily Armored Traits. On top of that, they are large enough to need 2 Opponent Sheets and must be faced in as many phases. After defeating one part, you move on to the next."
Golden Cobweb,"<strong>Golden Cobweb: </strong>See Cobweb. Cobwebs spun by golden silk orbweavers are extremely resistant. Anyone trying to break free from these cobwebs suffers -1. Additionally, trapped boggarts are unable to go juggernaut."
Hard to Kill,"<strong>Hard to Kill: </strong>When the Opponent reaches a Crucial Box, they activate their Move as usual, but do not suffer any additional Stress from the attack. For example, if the Opponent stands to suffer 3 Stress because of a Character-s attack, the Narrator must fill only the Stress boxes up to the Crucial Box and ignore all further Stress."
Hardened Shell,"<strong>Hardened Shell: </strong>The Opponent is protected by natural armor. Characters who attack with anything but a firearm, heavy, or ranged weapon suffer -1 to their Action Rolls."
Heavily Armored,"<strong>Heavily Armored: </strong>The Opponent is wearing a unique set of heavy armor. This could be a porcelain cuirass or a suit of cinder armor.

Huge,"<strong>Huge: </strong>The Opponent is either a beast twice as tall as a littling, or a small group of beasts that are bigger than a littling. All Huge Opponents have the Hard to Kill and Armed Traits. Characters outside of combat can easily shoot Huge beasts without any Hindrance from their fellow Characters in melee.

Littling,"<strong>Littling: </strong>The Opponent is a littling or group of littlings. The Narrator can tailor these Opponents by giving them additional Traits depending on their native Folk. Fairy Opponents can fly as if they had the Flying Trait. Characters shooting at flying Faeries always gain +1 to their roll. Boggart Opponents can go juggernaut when reaching their last Crucial Box. When they do this, they immediately gain the Large and Hardened Shell Traits. Sluagh and Undine Opponents can ignore a single successful attack."
Nimble,"<strong>Nimble: </strong>The Opponents movements are exceptionally quick and nimble. Characters who attack with two-handed weapons, firearms, ranged, or throwing weapons all suffer -1 to their Action Rolls."
Rust,"<strong>Rust: </strong>Janissaries undersign a Contract with Rust. Their weapons and even their bodies are covered in pinkish rust that makes them beyond venomous. Characters who fail to roll at least one Basic Success on their Reaction Turn immediately suffer the Poisoned and Sick Conditions."
