Their stingers are as sharp as needles. When flying, wasps emit a loud buzzing sound that makes them easy to spot. As such, they usually try to sneak up their prey from above by scampering on mushrooms or other raised surfaces.","<strong>War Buzz</strong>The wasps unleash a powerful and deafening buzz that makes even thinking hard.

It normally inhabits the damp depths of the Inbetweens, but there have been sightings of giant centipedes in Dreadwood and in the Kashab Desert, an alarming piece of news that brought together many scientists to search for a solution. None has been found yet. Facing this centipede is an insane feat, appealing only to hunters who really love strong emotions or the feeling of being chewed. Giant centipedes have more legs than anyone can count, probably more than any living being should reasonably have on their body, and they use them all to attack viciously. If you were wondering, each of these legs drips with venom, obviously. The most famous giant centipede in the House is “little” Bismilla, who escaped from Viscount Protopopolov's Zoological Garden. This beast is so conceited that it has the power to grant the Vainglory Contract.","<strong>Grand Slam: </strong>The giant centipede uses its huge body to violently charge against the Characters.

But if you still had doubts, you must know that they are dozens and dozens of tiny meters tall, and their legs are so long that they can easily step over houses like they were nothing. In the lands of the Horde and Free Dominions, if you want to be sure to never fall prey to these spiders, you must be especially careful to never venture in the damper recesses of the Inbetweens or among tall mushrooms. After all, everyone knows that these spiders have a habit of standing perfectly still, with their long legs camouflaging as mushroom stalks, only to close their grip on the unfortunate creatures that step amid them. The most cruel and violent of all huntsman spiders, and possibly the most ruthless creature in the House, is Xerxes, also known as the Sunset Devil. This legendary monster has its lair in the depths of the Kashab Desert, and it is powerful enough that it can grant a Wallstrider Contract.","<strong>Cobweb Storm: </strong>The huntsman spider weaves a huge web that covers everything.
